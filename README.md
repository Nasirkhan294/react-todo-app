# React TO DO application based on context api

This project was created for the article ["React coding interview task"](https://medium.com/@andrey.igorevich.borisov/react-coding-interview-task-c9f21fb872e2)

This application was intentionally broken, there are six critical issues that I resolved to make this app working:

1. Fixed an ability to display all tasks.
2. Fixed a layout, checkboxes should be listed in a column.
3. Fixed an ability to add a new task.
4. Fixed an ability to toggle a task.
5. Fixed an ability to delete a task.
6. Fixed an ability to count completed tasks.

The working example can be found at https://hn42m6.csb.app/
